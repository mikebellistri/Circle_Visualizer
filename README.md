# Circle_Visualizer

This is a basic visualizer. It will listen to the default inputs from the computer and take the sound from the left and right channels. If the sound goes above the threshold a random colored circle will appear on the screen. There can be at most 6 cirlces on the screen at one time. For best results, play a song from the computers speakers.
